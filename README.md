# ur10e
Norlab's controller for the UR10e manipulator with ROS and the official Universal Robots ROS driver

## To do
### Required
- Implement safety features such as a validation of the next joint position request.
- Implement joint position control mode.
- Implement collision detection.
- Implement validation of the inverse kinematics (currently, if the robot moves outside its 
    workspace, the robot does funny things).


### Nice to have
